        <td> Born & bought up in Delhi, Isha always wanted everyone to be able to experience the city's magic. Right after college, she set out to achieve this dream by building Discover Delhi with help from her family & college friends, Rajnish & Kavi. She hopes she has succeeded in sharing the charm of the city! </td>
        <td> While Rajnish does not believe in magic, he concedes Delhi has its charms. A practical & level-headed guy, he looks after the "boring stuff" that keeps our company going. You can reply on him to suggest the best food joints though!</td>
        <td> What's a CTO? Chief Trip Officer, ofcourse! Kavi has a knack for curating  experiences by blending fun activities, beautiful sights, and mouth-watering food (with help from Rajnish in this department) making every trip memorable for our visitors. You can also rely on him to know every nook & corner of the city, making our trips a truly unique adventure! </td>
